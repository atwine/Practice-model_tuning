# Practice-model_tuning
I have heard of bayesian model tuning techniques and in this repo I am looking at learning to work with some of those.

In the notebook above, I have re-implemented some of the things I have been learning in while commenting in such a way that someone new would understand.

Feel free to look around, I am still working on this project to make it better.
